This is a hard fork from https://github.com/VA3HDL/DSP_Pre_ProcessorV5 which was based upon the work of Jack Purdum, W8TEE & Al Peter, AC8GY from the book Microcontroller Projects for Amateur Radio.

The intent is to take the work of VA3HDL on enhancing the audio processing chain and encorporate the bigger touch screen from the original project.  Too much has changed between the versions to make a standard fork so we are starting fresh at this point.
