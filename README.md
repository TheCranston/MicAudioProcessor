This is a hard fork from https://github.com/VA3HDL/DSP_Pre_ProcessorV5 which was based upon the work of Jack Purdum, W8TEE & Al Peter, AC8GY from the book Microcontroller Projects for Amateur Radio. (https://groups.io/g/SoftwareControlledHamRadio)  Part of Pablo's enhancments were to integrate Marc Paquette's (https://github.com/MarkzP/AudioEffectDynamics) extensions to Chip Audette's (https://github.com/chipaudette/OpenAudio_ArduinoLibrary) expansion of Paul Stoffregen's Teensy Audio Library. (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Audio).  Say that three times...

The intent is to take the work of VA3HDL on enhancing the audio processing chain and encorporate the bigger touch screen from the original project.  Too much has changed between the versions to make a standard fork so we are starting fresh at this point.  We are also implementing the highly optimized double buffered display driver and GFX stack from Arvind Singh (https://github.com/vindar) and the F32 version of the audio library.
